                        Basically, my history on my works had been based just in 3 things,
                        Sells; (About 10 years selling timeshares, and some others),
                        English Teacher; (I´ve worked in one of the best schools in Mexico and some other, I did my system and I still have it, and I think is one of the best systems I´ve ever seen in my life) and Phone Operator, about 5 years being Customer Service and Seller
                        When I was younger I worked as a waiter for about 2 years, (in a coffee shop and in a bar), and in the last years, I´ve been studing for programming and interpreting; I want to change the Customer Service for the Interpreting, something real is that the hospitals are interesting. But at the end, Programming is something that I enjoy enough to making me to do my entire life.

                        I didn´t finish highschool, but I have done several studies that have helped me though my entire life.
                        I do speak english excelent, and about 50% of italian also.
                        As interpreter, I´d learned certain vocabulary like the one use in medcine.
                        I´ve been an english teacher for about 10 years
                        A sells man of timeshares and turistic atractions for more than 10 years.
                        I´ve have worked about 5 years as a Phone Operator, and I´ve studied Programming for the las years, and I´m doing well, but, as I suppoused, and I´ve learned, I´ve found out that there still is a very long way to go.

                        Hobbies in My life

                        During my entire life I have had many hobbies, many that I stopped enjoying, and some that I still have, like for example the literature, I use to tead a lot, but with the time I gfot tired of and sometimes I like listening some audio-books, but not that much.
                        I like writtting, all kind, novels, short stories, poems, and manythings aboutr what I have been learning, when I´m leatning it,
                        I use to play a lot video-games, this is not something that is not common, but, in order that I´m programming, it´s a bless, because I have arsenal enopugh to go up in case I´m needing it.
                        I use to enjoy traveling a lot, I went around Mexico and I had the chance to go up to 20 different states into the country plus some little town that have to say that are even more beatiful that the cities themselves.
                        Another hobby I had and sometimes I still have are the movies, I use to studied movies and I still have the move to. It helped me to know and understand the criteria of an image, knowing about the different types of scenes and its names, whitch is important, also how to wtite sctipt and how to fo with the correct flow like the gold script, and about scenes and squares.
                        Today, my top hobby is programming, I´ve been doing personal websites, videogames from js, and aducatives sites, those are more for companies, unless some that I did to myself like one for knowing more about hospitals and medicines.
                        Also, another of my hobbies are the grapes and wines, Long ago I wanted to be a sommeliere, so I did study about the regions, the lands, the different types of weathers, the grapes itself, processes, types of grapes, some advises, some secrets, and a lot of pairings, have to say that sometimes when I find some very good wine, I have to have it.

                        When I was younger, 19 years old, I started to work as an english teacher, I did that for more than 9 years.
                        I created a system for teaching English, I was about 30 years old, and I did my system for books on those days, I had the chance of using it few times.
                        After that I move the same system into an interactive program and I rent it or use it the way I need,
                        Also, I did a system for teaching English based on a medical vocabulary for hospitals.

                        Something I have dreamed is one day moving myself to Europe, I learned Italian and some french just to be ready when the moment comes, I want to be a very good programmer before I mobe, this is because I really want to be useful wherever place I decide to go, but for sure, the food must be tasty and the streets, walkeable and clean, actually, there are some p´laces in specific that I want to go like Greece and some cities in Italy like Verona, Pantellería, and Croacia.
